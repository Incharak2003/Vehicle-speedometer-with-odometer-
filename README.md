A speedometer is an instrument found in a vehicle that measures and displays the instantaneous speed of the vehicle. It's typically located on the dashboard within the driver's field of vision. The speedometer provides real-time feedback to the driver about how fast the vehicle is moving relative to the speed limits and road conditions.
Modern speedometers are usually electronic, though older vehicles may still have mechanical ones. Electronic speedometers work by receiving signals from the vehicle's speed sensor, which is usually located on the transmission or wheel hub. The speed sensor measures the rotation of a component, such as the driveshaft or wheel, and sends this data to the speedometer, which then displays the speed on the gauge.

Odometer:
An odometer is another instrument found in vehicles, typically located near the speedometer. Its function is to measure the distance traveled by the vehicle over time. Odometers provide important information about the vehicle's usage, such as for maintenance schedules and resale value.
Like speedometers, modern odometers are mostly electronic, but mechanical ones were prevalent in older vehicles. The odometer receives data from the vehicle's speed sensor as well, but instead of displaying speed, it accumulates the distance traveled based on the rotations of the vehicle's components.
